# thheedle-next

A new iteration of thheedle. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Development & Deployment

Run `npm run dev` to host the project on a local network that reloads upon save.

Run `npm run build` to build the project as a set of static files to `out` that can be hosted with a basic web server (e.g. `serve out`).

TODO: Set up deployment to S3 with Github workflows
